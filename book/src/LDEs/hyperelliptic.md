# Hypperelliptic Curves

[Dobson & Galbraight (2020)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/196.pdf)

> Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 or 3. The Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve forms a group similar to the points on an elliptic curve, but the order of such (sub)-groups appears to be harder to compute than in the elliptic curve case. While the Supersonic paper did not evaluate hyperelliptic curves as candidate groups of unknown order, they should have appealing properties in this application, such as smaller proof sizes and more efficient commitment and verification operations, without a trusted setup.
