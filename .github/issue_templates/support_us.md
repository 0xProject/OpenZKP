Help support Babel!

Babel has always been a community project, not really backed or owned by any single (or group) of companies. While some maintainers used to work at Facebook (and Henry at Adobe) no one was working on it full time and there certainly isn't a huge company or team anywhere doing all this work.

As a group of volunteers you can help us in a few ways

- Giving developer time on the project. (Message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/babeljs) or [Slack](https://slack.babeljs.io/) for guidance). Companies should be paying their employees to contribute back to the open source projects they use everyday.
- Giving funds by becoming one of our sponsors/donators!

If you'd like to sustain the future of the project as a whole, we have an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel) that you can donate to. This is a way for funds to be allocated to the core team.

You can also support [Henry](https://github.com/hzoo) directly since I [left my job to work on Babel and Open Source full time](https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/969793227862790144) at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/henryzhu).
